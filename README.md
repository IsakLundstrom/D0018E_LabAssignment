This is our solution to the D0018E lab assignment at LTU. It is based on MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, EJS and CSS and was hosted at a DUST server located at LTU maintained by LUDD.

N.B. Everyone contributed to the soultion though only one git acount was used when commiting any changes from the server when ssh connections was used from remote computers.
